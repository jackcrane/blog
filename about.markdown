Hi! 

My name is Jack Crane and I am a high school student in Cincinnati, Ohio. I love writing code and finding unique and innovative ways to share information and make the world a better place. I have written code for everyone from a one-person nonprofit to startups to a fortune-500 company.

I love helping people learn to code. I love technology and I adore passing my knowledge and skills on to the next generation of programmers.

I am *super* comfortable with
- ES2015 and ES6 JavaScript (both browser and node.js)
- CSS (recently I have been using LESS to preprocess my CSS)
- HTML
- Markdown
- PHP
- MySQL

I am good enough to get by with
- Python
- Java
- React Native

I am learning
- React
- Firebase / Supabase
