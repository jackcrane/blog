## The Idea

The point was to make a website for my robotics team. It is a simple, down-to-earth, static information-rich website.

## The Features (or planned features)

- [x] Images that show information on hover
- [x] Pages for all reasonable information

## The tech stack

Frontend:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- GitHub Pages

## What happened

I stopped mantaining this website after most the team graduated and I left the team.

## Live site
