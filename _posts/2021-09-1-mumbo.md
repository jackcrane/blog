## The Idea

Inspired by Hermitcraft Season 6 (dont ask), I decided to make a mayoral campaiging website for MumboJumbo. The goal was to mostly be a joke, but to provide a slight amoung of information mixed with a game and jokes.

## The Features (or planned features)

- [x] Custom logo resembling MumboJumbo's iconic mustache
- [x] A game based on 'grumbot'
- [x] A page showing off the testamonials for MumboJumbo

## The tech stack

Frontend:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- GitHub Pages

## What happened

The website got a few hits, but I never pursued marketing it because that would be stupid
## Live site
