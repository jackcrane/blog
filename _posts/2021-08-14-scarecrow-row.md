## The Idea

Scarecrow Row is a fun fall installation of unique and creative scarecrows set along the 2-mile bike and walking trail of Otto Armleder Park, located on Cincinnati’s eastside next to Lunken Airport and Playfield.

Individuals, organizations and businesses submit one of a kind, themed scarecrows, that will amuse and entertain visitors throughout the month of October.

Scarecrow row serves as a fundraiser for Madi’s House, a relapse prevention and mental health community center, serving young adults battling addiction and mental health illness in the greater Cincinnati area.
