## The Idea

Tofly was my first exploration into developing software using API calls. I found a weather API and made an app where it reports the weather read by stations at airports all around the world.

## The Features (or planned features)

- [x] Attractive website
- [x] Easy-to-use search
- [x] API call and output

## The tech stack

Frontend:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- GitHub Pages

## What happened

I used an image I did not have permission to use (this was a tiny project that never was to be launched) and was asked by the photographer to remove the site and all source code.
