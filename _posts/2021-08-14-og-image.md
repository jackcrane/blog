## The Idea

I was inspired by [Vercel's opengraph image generator](https://og-image.vercel.app/) but didn't want to paste their logo over everything (especially because I dont use vercel), and I was not happy with their options for images, so I decided to clone it. It provides a simple endpoint (called data.png) with not GET arguments so it will always work with social media platforms.

## The Features (or planned features)

- [x] Simple generator UI
- [x] Several selectable backgrounds
- [x] Input for title, subtitle, URL, and URL Protocol
- [x] Live preview with image and code sample

## The tech stack

Frontend:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

Backend:

- Node.js (express)
- DigitalOcean App Platform

## What happened

This is a live and evolving project, I made it primarily for myself but figured I may as well make it availble to the world.
