## The Idea

I was peeved with the difficulty of finding high quality quizlets for my classes, especially when dealing with teachers with common names (i.e. *Smith*). Quizlet's own search engine was typically pretty decent, but I was always looking for some more advanced searching tools that were better implemented than Quizlet's classes feature. I decided to venture into building my own app.

## The Features (or planned features)

- [x] Attractive 2-side homepage
- [x] Signup page, complete with a web scraping system to fetch additional information about the study set from Quizlet's site
- [x] A search engine with advanced filters for teachers, classes, schools, and assignments
- [ ] A publically accessable API
- [ ] Advertisement implementation

## The tech stack

Frontend:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

Backend:

- PHP
- Python (BeautifulSoup)
- MySQL
- DigitalOcean Droplet

## What happened

After working hard on Quizlet Coalition (QC) for a few weeks, I set off to begin marketing. After a few lazy reddit posts, I had acquired 3 returning users and about 30 hits on the website. Reasonably satisfied with the performance of my reddit posts, I continued to some more careful and targeted marketing which yieled a gigantic zero on all metrics. After several more weeks of working on the tech, I had nothing to show for it. With the cloud VM costing me money with aboslutely no return, I made the decision to shut down the project.
